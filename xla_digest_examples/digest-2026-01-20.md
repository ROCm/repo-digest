# XLA Daily Digest - 2026-01-20

## Summary
A light day for XLA with two focused commits: a floating-point truncation safety fix in the CPU codegen path and a test infrastructure improvement to prevent GPU autotuner timeouts.

## Key Changes

### 🔴 High Priority
No high-priority changes today.

### 🟡 Medium Priority
- Disable autotuner parallelism in all tests [1ed11c9](https://github.com/openxla/xla/commit/1ed11c94f6c562681c784766379a3d58f6dba0fd)

    Prevents test timeouts when running with heap checker by disabling multi-threaded GPU autotuning in the HLO hardware-independent test base. Improves test reliability across the GPU backend test suite.

- In Fptrunc, truncate larger int constants and add checks [d767ad2](https://github.com/openxla/xla/commit/d767ad2b63bafde46c10bf3b076b0a74419afd7c)

    Fixes safety issue in floating-point truncation by masking constant values to fit scalar type bit widths and adding DCHECK assertions to catch invalid bias differences. Includes comprehensive test coverage for F16/F32/F64 to F8E5M2 conversions, including overflow and special value handling.

### 🟢 Low Priority
No low-priority changes today.
